# FRF-Data-Project-ZGB

## Project Overview:

**Welcome to my FRF-DATA Project**, developed as part of the _FRF's Bootcamp_, called "DATACAMP". Over the course of this 4-week program, participants are challenged to identify a specific problem within the world of football and apply data-driven techniques to improve performance or gain strategic insights.

The project is structured around **four key phases**:

### 1. Business Context

In this initial phase, I will define the specific football-related problem or question I aim to address using open-source and publicly available data provided by the bootcamp organizers.

This section will outline:

- The core problem or challenge
- Its relevance and impact within the football ecosystem
- My approach to tackling the problem
- A roadmap outlining the key milestones and outcomes for the project

### 2. Data Engineering Phase

Here, I will identify and curate the most relevant datasets aligned with my project theme. This involves:

- Extracting data from local or cloud sources
- Cleaning, transforming, and storing it in a structured format (e.g., database)
- Documenting each step of the data pipeline, along with clear justifications for every decision made

### 3. Data Analysis Phase

In this phase, I will analyze the prepared data to uncover meaningful insights related to the chosen problem.  
The goal is to generate clear, actionable results and to communicate findings in a way thatâ€™s both logical and intuitive.

### 4. Data Visualization Phase

Finally, I will refine the data and methodology, and present the key findings through visual storytelling.  
This phase will include:

- Final adjustments to data and analysis
- Interactive and static visualizations
- Recommendations for immediate improvements and potential directions for future exploration
